## About this lab

:warning: A grading script and a setup utility exist inside of the `.github/` directory. You do not need to use these workflows for any purpose and **altering their contents will affect the repository's ability to assess your lab and give feedback.**

:warning: This lab utilizes [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), which is free for public repositories and self-hosted runners, but may incur charges on private repositories. See *[About billing for GitHub Actions]* to learn more.

:information_source: The use of GitHub Actions also means that it may take the grading workflow a few seconds and sometimes minutes to run.

## Instructions

1. Create your own copy of this repository by using the [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) button. Make sure you set your repository visibility to **Public** when asked.
2. In your newly created repository, enable GitHub Pages with the `main` branch and the `docs/` directory as the source for the GitHub Pages site.

## Seeing your result

Your lab is graded automatically once you have completed the instructions. To see the result of your lab, click the **Actions** tab, select the **Grading workflow**, and select the most recent workflow run. The status of the workflow indicates if you have passed or failed the lab.

If the workflow failed, scroll down to the **Annotations** section to check what went wrong.

See *[Viewing workflow run history]* if you need assistance.

## Troubleshooting

 If the grading workflow does not automatically run after you complete the instructions, run the troubleshooter: in the **Actions** tab select the **Grading workflow**, click **Run workflow**, select the appropriate branch (usually `main`), and click the **Run workflow** button.

 See *[Running a workflow on GitHub]* if you need assistance.
